# Intoduction to Image Matching using SIFT and BFMatcher
#### In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of image matching using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm and the Brute-Force Matcher (BFMatcher) in the OpenCV library. Our objective is to identify and visualize correspondences between distinctive features in two images, allowing us to gain insights into their similarities.
